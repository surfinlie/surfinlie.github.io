Wellcome, this is surfinlie - as in Surfin' Lie Theory, one of my favourite subjects in mathematics.
I am a student of pure and applied mathematics at the University of Lisbon. My mindset towards mathematics is that each subject is connected to eachother and part its beuty lies in founding out how such connection work. 
I keep myself motivated through writing about a variety of math subjects I have learnt. 

John Von Neumann once said to Felix Smith, "[...] in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
(or you write a blogpost about them... =)
