Welcome, this is surfinlie - as in Surfin' Lie Theory, one of my favourite subjects in mathematics.
I keep myself motivated through writing about a variety of math subjects I have learnt. 

Studying mathematics at the University of Lisbon. My attitude towards maths is: "different" domains of mathematics may be in accuality deeply connected.

John Von Neumann once said to Felix Smith, "[...] in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
(or you write a blogpost about them... =)
