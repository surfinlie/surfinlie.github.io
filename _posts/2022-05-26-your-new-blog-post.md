## The struggle over Mathematics

#### Category theory provides the framework and language to write mathematical objects in terms of their categories. Here we provide a comprehensive view on the construction of Lie objects via their categorical representations.

I was never good at math, in fact I failed many times: from tests and exams to small quizzes, speccialy during high school. At this stage in my short academic life I had constructed preconception on math which naturally enough were holding me back from learning the topics effectivly, feeding back on the distaste of it. At that stage learning mathematics seemed not only a difficult task but a task that I knew I wans't good at due to my history with it.  

A Lie group is a group and a differentiable manifold. 
A Lie algebra is the infinitesimal representation of a Lie group.
